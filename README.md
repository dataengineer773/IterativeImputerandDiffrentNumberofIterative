By Defult the iterativeImputer will repeat the number of iterations 10 times, it is possible that a large number of iteration may begin to bias or skew th estimate and that few iterations may be prefred. the number of
iterations of the procedure can be specified via the max_iter argument, it may be intersting to evaluate diffrent numbers of iterations.
